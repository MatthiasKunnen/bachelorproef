# Thesis
This repository contains the required files to compile my thesis of 2017 that I
made in the pursuit of my bachelor in 
[Applied Computer Science](https://www.hogent.be/studiefiches/?ectsaction=ects:main.modeltrajecten&opl=PBA-TIN&faculteitcode=FBO&taal=2).

A compiled version(.pdf) can be found in the releases. 

# Abstract
This thesis researches general problems and fraud in business processes using
first hand experience and describes how these can be solved. The goal is to
bring problems into the spotlight and provide a solution. The implementation of
the solution, a Web Of Trust, will then be discussed.

Certain problems mentioned in this thesis are growing in terms of amount of
occurrences. This causes economical damage as well as reputational damage.
Companies could use this thesis as a basis to roll out a system that secures the
problems which are mentioned.

The thesis first searches for methods that provide authentication, integrity and
non-repudiation and later on compares these methods. The comparison concludes
that a Web Of Trust is a better way for the current purpose and the Web Of Trust
is then looked into and implemented.

This thesis might be followed up with a proof of concept or full on
implementation of the provided solution which will prove the correctness
thereof.
